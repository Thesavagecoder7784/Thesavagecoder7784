### About me 👨🏻‍💻:
***I am an aspiring data scientist who belives that the power to harnessing data lies with using the right tools and rules for communication.***

**I am a high school (senior year) student 👨‍🎓**

**I primarily program for data science, machine learning using python 🐍 (my notebooks on [GitHub](https://github.com/Thesavagecoder7784/Statistical-Data-Analysis-With-Pandas)). However I am comfortable using SQL and Java to solve other programs**

**I am also experienced in using Tableau. Check out my Tableau public profile [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/prabhat6777#!/)**

**Feel free out check out my Linkedin [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prabhat-palraj-237719172/)**

🔭 I’m currently working on some interesting projects based on machine learning and natural language processing

📄I'm documenting all of the machine learning and some deep learning algorithms which I use or intend to use in my data science journey in my latest repository - [Machine Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/Thesavagecoder7784/Machine-Learning-Algorthims)

📈Another intereseting repository I have is my Natural Language Processing repositroy to document my learning process from very basic syntax to solving some problems using NLP and implementing interesting aspects of NLP such as sentic computing etc.

🌱 I’m currently experimenting with advanced machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing

💬 Ask me about coding with python and implementing ML, NLP solutions

🎸 And while Im not coding, I might be creating covers with my guitar and wrting new songs 🎶🎵
