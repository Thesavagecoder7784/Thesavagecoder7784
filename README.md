***I am an aspiring data scientist who belives that the power to harnessing data lies with using the right tools and rules for communication.***

### About me: 
- 1️⃣6️⃣ years old 
- 👨‍🎓 High school (senior year) student 
- 👨🏻‍💻 Data science intern

**I primarily program for data science, machine learning using python (my notebooks on [GitHub](https://github.com/Thesavagecoder7784/Statistical-Data-Analysis-With-Pandas)). However I am comfortable using SQL and Java to solve other problems**

**I use Tableau for data visualization purposes and I am in the process of being certified by Tableau as a Data Scientist. For a taste of my data visualization work, check out my Tableau public profile [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/prabhat6777#!/)**

🔭 I’m currently working on some interesting projects based on machine learning and natural language processing

📄 I'm documenting all of the machine learning and some deep learning algorithms which I use or intend to use in my data science journey in my latest repository - [Machine Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/Thesavagecoder7784/Machine-Learning-Algorthims)

📈 Another intereseting repository I have is my Natural Language Processing repositroy to document my learning process from very basic syntax to solving some problems using NLP and implementing interesting aspects of NLP such as sentic computing etc. It can be found [here](https://github.com/Thesavagecoder7784/NaturalLanguageProcessing-NLP-)

🌱 I’m currently developing my own Machine learning solution to help analysts. Coming soon...

💬 Ask me about data analysis, visualization & implementing ML, NLP solutions
