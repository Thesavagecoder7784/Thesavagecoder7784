Writing code no one asked for, but everyone might eventually need.

I’m currently working on implementing algorithms in the quantitative finance space, while also developing neurosymbolic AI solutions for real-world applications to address specific problems.

As for projects, I want to create algorithms in Formula 1 Racing to uncover insights and optimize race strategy. I'm trying to stay consistent and post those insights on my Twitter page as well.

I'm documenting all of the machine learning algorithms and their application to solving problems in my repository - [Machine Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/Thesavagecoder7784/Machine-Learning-Algorthims)
