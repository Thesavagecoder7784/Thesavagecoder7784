I’m currently working on implementing neurosymbolic AI in the real world to solve problems.

As for projects, I want to implement ML algorithms in Formula 1 Racing to uncover insights and optimize race strategy.

Find my latest article about adversarial attacks [here](https://prabhatm27.medium.com/adversarial-attacks-on-neural-networks-460aaf8ddfb1)

I'm documenting all of the machine learning algorithms and their application to solving problems in my repository - [Machine Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/Thesavagecoder7784/Machine-Learning-Algorthims)

**I use Tableau for data visualization purposes. For a taste of my data visualization work, check out my Tableau public profile [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/prabhat6777#!/)**
